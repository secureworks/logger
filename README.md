`secureworks/logger` is a unified interface that wraps popular logging libraries such as [Logrus][logrus] and [Zerolog][zerolog], and can instrument automatic reporting to services such as [Sentry][sentry]... _And that is just the beginning!_

This is the official Golang logging library used in such projects as the [SecureWorks Taegisâ„¢ XDR (Extended Detection and Response)][taegis-xdr] Cloud Platform, and is suggested for use with the [Taegis Golang SDK][taegis-sdk].

## Installation

Run the command:

```
$ go get -u github.com/secureworks/logger/log
```

Alternatively, if your project is using Go Modules then, reference `logger` in a file with import:

```go
import "github.com/secureworks/logger/log"
```

Run any Go command and the toolchain will resolve and fetch the `logger` module automatically.

## Usage

[Documentation is available on pkg.go.dev][godocs]. You should also look at the examples in the main package.

## License
